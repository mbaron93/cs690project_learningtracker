An app for tracking one's learning from books and webpages. 

Scenario: A Day in the Life of Oliver

Morning: Oliver sits at his desk with a cup of tea and a pile of books he’s borrowed from the library. He opens one and thinks, “This looks familiar—did I already read this last year?” He flips through the pages, but it doesn’t jog his memory.

Late Morning: While scrolling through an article online, Oliver finds a fascinating topic he wants to explore further. He bookmarks the page but realizes his bookmark folder is a mess of unrelated links. “I should have a way to organize all the things I want to learn,” he mutters.

Lunch: At lunch, Oliver chats with his friend Emma, who talks about her reading challenge for the year. “I’ve read 25 books so far,” she says. Oliver is impressed but realizes he has no idea how many books he’s finished this year or how much time he’s spent on them.

Afternoon: After finishing a chapter in his book, Oliver decides to check his progress. “How long did it take me to read the last few chapters?” he wonders, wishing he had logged his reading sessions.

Evening: At the end of the day, Oliver reflects on how much he loves learning through books and articles. “If I had a way to track what I’ve read, organize my ideas, and set learning goals, I’d feel more accomplished,” he thinks as he turns off the light.
